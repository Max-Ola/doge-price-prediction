# doge-price-prediction

To create a Dogecoin price prediction application using the Django web framework, you could use a machine learning model that has been trained to predict the future price of Dogecoin based on historical data. This model could be integrated into a Django application that allows users to input certain parameters, such as the time period for the prediction and any relevant information about the current market conditions, and then displays the predicted price.

This code uses Pandas to load the historical Dogecoin data into a DataFrame, trains a linear regression model on the data, and then uses the trained model to make a prediction based on the user-specified time period and market conditions. The prediction result is then rendered in an HTML template using Django's render function.
